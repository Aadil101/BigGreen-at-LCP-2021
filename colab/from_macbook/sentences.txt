[CLS] Another point that I cannot ignore , either , is that this report is being debated within a ' new era ' in terms of monetary policy - with interest rates that have been rising for some time and threaten to keep on rising - and at a stage when we are embarking on the new Stability and Growth Pact as revised by the Commission , and when the Member States are for the first time coming before the European institutions to account for what they have done regarding the Lisbon Strategy in their national reform plans .
